    Victorious is an American television series created by Dan Schneider for 
    Nickelodeon. The  first episode date was 27 March 2010. The series revolves around aspiring singer Tori Vega, 
    portrayed by Victoria Justice, who attends a performing arts
    high school while getting into wacky screwball situations on a daily basis. 
    It all started as her less talented sister Trina had gotten an allergic reaction 
    to Chinese herb and Tori was forced to take over her.
