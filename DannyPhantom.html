      Danny Fenton was once your typical kid until he accidentally blew 
      up his parents laboratory and became a ghost-hunting superhero. He 
      straddles with living two different life. He frequently saves his town
      and the world from ghost attacks while being a shy freshmen at Casper
      Hight. The first episode was dropped 2004 April 3. It was  originally 
      supposed to be called Danny Phantom and the Specter Detectors. 
      Throughout his adventures, Danny made a number of allies, including his 
      half-ghost female clone and cousin, Dani Phantom, a Yeti-like ghost named Frostbite,
      the Master of Time by the name of Clockwork, a werewolf ghost named Wulf and Pandora, the owner
      of Pandora's Box. Fun fact Danny Phantom was created by Butch Hartman, who is the creator
      of The Fairly OddParents.
